Quick Start
===========

Getting started with megapode should be a quick process. Before you start, 
get your favourite Java IDE set up. Megapode uses an embedded web server, 
based on Apache's HTTPCore, so you wont need Tomcat or other Application Server. 

As it is pretty standard, and makes the set up simple, this tutorial uses Maven, 
so you should set up your first project accordingly. There is a sandbox on 
Github [https://github.com/ranoble/megapode-sandbox] that you can use to get 
the project structure up and running.

You'll also need a RDBMS database, with a JDBC driver.
