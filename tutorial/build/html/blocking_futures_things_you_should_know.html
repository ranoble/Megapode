<h1>Components, Blocking, Futures, and things you should know...<a class="headerlink" href="#components-blocking-futures-and-things-you-should-know" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You should have a pretty solid understanding of concurrent patterns before
writing applications in Megapode, but it isn&#8217;t strictly necessary. The framework
aims to hold your hand somewhat.</p>
<p>You can skip this section if you want and come back to it at a later time, but
a lot of what happens from here, depends on the following subject matter.</p>
<div class="section" id="invoking-megapode-components">
<h2>Invoking Megapode Components<a class="headerlink" href="#invoking-megapode-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All core components (except Pages, which are never called directly), make use of
Dynamic proxies to wire up the messages. These take three forms.</p>
<p>The <em>Widgets proxy</em>, only ever returns a IWidget interface which only has a build
method. This takes a argument list which is passed into the initialise method of
the widget and the coordinated methods are then called in order, as described in
the previous section.</p>
<p>The <em>Renderers proxy</em> always returns IRenderer, which allows you to call render in
two ways.</p>
<p>The other components, <em>DataAccessor, Task, Calculation</em> all allow you to define an
interface, and a class, and will route the message accordingly, and return the
response (except task, which always returns void / null).</p>
<p>Each of these is addressed in their sections in this guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="futures">
<h2>Futures<a class="headerlink" href="#futures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Megapode uses Akka&#8217;s (Scala&#8217;s) future model. This [<a class="reference external" href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0/java/futures.html">http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.0/java/futures.html</a>] is an excellent primer on the
topic.</p>
<p>In brief though, a Future is a wrapper for a value that will be fulfilled at some
stage to come. A Promise is returns a future, and allows a developer to fulfil that
future value at some point.</p>
<p>Most of Megapode consists of passing messages that will be handled later by some
other process. For this, the future is a tailor made mechanism. This enables us to
define arbitrary methods, use an interface to define a contract that you can use in
your client code, and implement a concrete implementation with the same signature
but very different internals. Dynamic proxies then handle the task of routing
and fulfilment for you. This is demonstrated in the Calculation section.</p>
<p>Once again, you could just ignore this, and wire the messages yourself, should you
choose to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-completion-and-flattening-of-futures">
<h2>Future completion, and flattening of Futures<a class="headerlink" href="#future-completion-and-flattening-of-futures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OK, so you have a future. This isn&#8217;t much use. At some stage, you actually need
the result...</p>
<p>You can wait for completion by <strong>blocking</strong>, using:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Object result = Await.result(future, timeout.duration());
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can use a callback:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>future.onComplete(new OnComplete&lt;Object&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(Throwable arg0, Object response) throws Throwable {
        //handle result here
    }
});
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, the non-blocking callback is preferred. But what if you want to use the result to
call another Future. Look at the following</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>future.onComplete(new OnComplete&lt;Object&gt;() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(Throwable arg0, Object response) throws Throwable {
        Future&lt;Object&gt; new_future = someMethod(response);
        new_future.onComplete(new OnComplete&lt;Object&gt;() {
            @Override
            public void onComplete(Throwable arg0, Object response) throws Throwable {
                ... and potentially more nesting
            }
        });
    }
});
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This could lead to a tangle of nested completions handlers.</p>
<p>Megapode provides a When(){ finishes() }.itWill() pattens to flatten futures.</p>
<p>When takes a list of arguments, some of them futures and itWill returns a future.
When all of the futures have completed, it will call finishes, passing in all the arguments
in the original order, with the completed results in place of any futures. It then maps
the new future to the itWill future returned earlier, and will complete accordingly.</p>
<p>Therefore in the above example</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>// context is the current execution context
Future future ....
Future&lt;Object&gt; new_future = (new When(context, future){
        @Override
        Future&lt;?&gt; finishes(Throwable exception, Object... params){
            return someMethod(params[0]);
        }
    }).itWill();
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blocking-and-components">
<h2>Blocking and Components<a class="headerlink" href="#blocking-and-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, blocking is to be avoided, but in Megapode two of the Component types block,
as they need to retain state during their execution. These are the Widget and the Page
components. By default (it&#8217;s Megapode, change it if you want...) these components provide
a default flow. The object is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>constructed</li>
<li>initialised</li>
<li>collect is called</li>
<li>prepare is called</li>
<li>render is called</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>and the response is send via a message back to the caller.</p>
<p>There is a rule here, a developer should attempt to make sure that, as far as is logical,
as much of the computation is done in parallel as is possible. To do this, most tasks are
done via calling Futures. But, at some time, you will want the result back, and that
this returns reliably.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, Megapode provides a set method. To use it however, the field you use
<strong>must have a setter and a getter</strong>. This is the most common bug that we have found.</p>
<p>The set method takes a field name, and a future, and sets the value of that field with the
result of that future <strong>before the next coordinated method is called</strong>.
As an example</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre> @Page(path=&quot;/&quot;)
 public class ArticlePage extends PageBase{
     ...
     User author;
     //setter and getter

     @Override
public void collect() {
         Future&lt;User&gt; futureAuthor = ...
         set(&quot;author&quot;, futureAuthor);
         //at this point author == null
     }

     @Override
public void prepare() {
         //at this point author will have been populated or an exception thrown.
     }
     ...
 }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>OK, so that takes care of setting, but what if we want to run a number of tasks, perhaps nested? We can create a delaying promise...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="delaying-promise">
<h2>Delaying Promise<a class="headerlink" href="#delaying-promise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>if, for some reason, you need to ensure that the next method doesn&#8217;t start until you have
completed some work, you can call</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">Promise</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">delay</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">delayUntilComplete</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>this will cause the next method to wait until the delay is complete, which you can indicate by
calling delay.successful(...) or delay.failure(...). Normall this is done in a callback, but
be careful, you will <strong>have</strong> to complete it or the component will not ever complete.</p>
